PPT named 'MultiContainerRuntime.pdf' \& the SCREENSHOTS are in 'screenshots.pdf'**
A lightweight container runtime built on Linux namespaces, with a kernel module for memory enforcement and CFS scheduling experiments.

\#commands

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update \&\& sudo apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

### Build \& Load

```bash
make all               # builds: engine, cpu\_hog, memory\_hog, io\_pulse, monitor.ko
sudo insmod monitor.ko
ls -l /dev/container\_monitor
```

### Prepare Filesystems

```bash
mkdir rootfs-base
wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86\_64/alpine-minirootfs-3.20.3-x86\_64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf alpine-minirootfs-3.20.3-x86\_64.tar.gz -C rootfs-base
sudo cp cpu\_hog memory\_hog io\_pulse rootfs-base/
sudo cp -a rootfs-base rootfs-alpha \&\& sudo cp -a rootfs-base rootfs-beta
mkdir -p logs
```

### Run

```bash
# Terminal 1
sudo ./engine supervisor ./rootfs-base

# Terminal 2
sudo ./engine start alpha ./rootfs-alpha /cpu\_hog --nice 10
sudo ./engine start beta  ./rootfs-beta  /cpu\_hog --nice -5
```

### CLI

```bash
sudo ./engine ps            # list containers
sudo ./engine logs alpha    # view logs
sudo ./engine stop alpha    # stop container
```

### Teardown

```bash
# Ctrl+C in Terminal 1
sudo rmmod monitor
```

## Architecture

**Isolation.** Each container gets three Linux namespaces — `CLONE\_NEWPID`, `CLONE\_NEWUTS`, and `CLONE\_NEWNS` — combined with `chroot()` to redefine the filesystem root. The host kernel is still shared; a kernel exploit affects all containers simultaneously.

**Supervisor.** A long-running supervisor reaps zombie children, routes logs, serves CLI commands, and enforces memory limits. `clone()` (not `fork()`) creates containers with new namespaces. The `waitpid()` loop retries until it returns 0 because Linux may coalesce multiple `SIGCHLD` signals.

**IPC.** Container stdout/stderr flows through pipes into a bounded buffer, then to a logger thread. CLI control uses a UNIX domain socket at `/tmp/mini\_runtime.sock` with fixed-size request/response structs. Keeping the two channels separate avoids message framing complexity.

**Kernel memory monitor.** RSS is read via `get\_mm\_rss()` directly from `mm\_struct` on a kernel timer. Crossing the soft limit logs a warning; crossing the hard limit fires `send\_sig(SIGKILL, task, 1)` with `force=1`, bypassing signal blocking. A spinlock (not mutex) protects the monitored list because the timer runs in softirq context and cannot sleep.

**Scheduler.** CFS assigns CPU time proportional to each task's weight, derived from its nice value. A container at nice −5 (weight 6,273) received \~10–15× more CPU than one at nice +10 (weight 110). I/O-bound processes stay responsive without priority elevation because voluntary sleeping keeps their `vruntime` low.

## Design Decisions

**Namespace scope.** Only PID, UTS, and mount namespaces are used. Network namespaces require virtual Ethernet pairs, bridge interfaces, and IP routing — plumbing that doesn't contribute to the core objectives.

**Event loop.** A `select()`-based loop suffices at a maximum of 32 containers (≤33 fds). `epoll` would add \~150 lines with no measurable benefit at this scale.

**Bounded buffer.** A mutex and condition variables are used over a lock-free ring buffer. Lock-free structures require architecture-specific memory barriers and are hard to verify correct; for log throughput, the simpler approach is entirely adequate.

**Wire protocol.** Fixed-size packed C structs sent raw over the UNIX socket give zero serialization overhead and no external dependencies. Forward-compatibility is not a concern for an internal tool.
